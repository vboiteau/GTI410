Version 1.6.2, 2006-02-08
- Corrected a bug in the image creating (null pointer if cancel is clicked
  in the file selection dialog).
- Changed the code for the correlation (filtering) such that it is less
  likely that students interchange columns and rows.

Version 1.6.1, 2005-12-09
- Removed the gti410.jpg file from the project

Version 1.6.0, 2004-08-31
- Corrected many bugs (e.g., boundary color in the fill user interface
was not refreshing correctly, remote translating of rectangles, ui
layout)
- Worked on the support of the undo operation (added many mementos).
- Implemented many features (e.g., seed filling now uses a stack
instead of recursive calls, revamped the user interface for curves,
added a combobox with filter types in the filter user interface,
modified the mediators and color result in the color dialog such that
it is simpler to keep the different color tabs in sync).

Version 1.5.0, 2004-03-22
- Corrected a bug which caused a null pointer exception when creating a new 
  curve while a shape (not a curve nor a control point) was selected.
- Added support for the shape to return their bounding rectangle.
- Selected shapes are highlighted with points along their bounding rectangle.
- Made the addition of control points easier by handling the mouse release
  message (instead of the mouse clicked one).
- The translation of objects is now accomplished with Affine transformations
  (instead of translating the center). This will become useful
  when the transformation code is added.
- Began adding the code to support commands.
- Partially added code for undo support.
- User interface for geometric transformations was added (translation, 
  rotation, shear, scale).

Version 1.4.1, 2004-03-02
- Corrected color modification.
- Corrected null pointer exception bug of curves.

Version 1.4.0, 2004-03-02
- Added the code for the curves lab.

Version 1.3.2, 2004-02-19
- Fixed a problem of the FilterPanel that prevented the FilteringTransformer
  that computes the filtering from recieving the values of the filter from
  the UI.
- Fixed a problem in the MeanFilter3x3 class which caused wrong filtering and
  was particularly problematic if the values of the filter were changed to a
  Laplacian filter.

Version 1.3.1, 2004-02-13
- Fixed the UI of the filtering kernel such that the FilteringTransformer is
  called when Enter is hit with the newly entered values.

Version 1.3.0, 2004-02-11
- Added the filtering user interface, abstract classes and example concrete
  classes.

Version 1.2.0, 2004-01-28
- Modified the selection mechanism such that objects on top are selected
  instead of objects at the bottom.
- Added user interface for seed fills and an example class (ImageLineFiller).

Version 1.1.1
- The selection mechanism was cleaned up and simplified. Many bugs were
  fixed.
- Code was added for a new object type: Image

Version 1.1.0
- Fixed a problem with inappropriate updates of the color picker and wrong 
  colors assigned to the object when OK was clicked without touching the
  color sliders.

Version 1.0.3, 2004-01-14
- This was the first stable release. 
- It includes two primitives (Disc and Rectangle) and a color picker for RGB
  with UI to help in creating CMYK, HLS and other color models.
- It fixed the major problems caused by incorrect commits that happened just
  after 05h55EDT. All these changes can be easily identified since they all
  come from user tzeblackwizard.
